#📌 Overview
This project analyzes sales data from different months to identify trends, understand customer purchasing behavior, and derive meaningful insights using Python and data science techniques.

#❓ Key Questions Explored
📊 What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
🏙️ Which city had the highest number of sales?
⏰ What time should we display advertisements to maximize purchases?
🔗 What products are most often sold together?
🔥 What product sold the most? Why was it the most popular?

#🏆 What I Learned
🔹 Working with Python Libraries
Improved skills in Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization.

#🔹 The Importance of Data Cleaning
Cleaning and preprocessing data is crucial to get accurate and meaningful results.

#🔹 Understanding Sales Trends
By analyzing historical sales data, I identified seasonal variations, top-selling products, and peak revenue months.

#📈 Results & Findings
📍 December was the best month for sales with the highest revenue.
📍 San Francisco (or the city identified in the analysis) had the most sales.
📍 Peak purchase hours were identified to optimize ad placement.
📍 Some products were frequently bought together, useful for bundle offers.
📍 The best-selling product was analyzed, explaining why it was the most popular.

#⚠️ Challenges Faced
🚧 Handling Missing & Inconsistent Data
Some sales data was missing or inconsistent, requiring careful cleaning and preprocessing.

#📊 Creating Clear Visualizations
Choosing the right graphs to make the data easy to understand was challenging.

#⚖️ Balancing Depth vs. Simplicity
Had to decide how much detail to include while keeping the project clear and concise.

#📌 Conclusion
🔹 This analysis helped understand sales trends, customer behavior, and top-selling products.
🔹 December was the most profitable month, and certain cities had higher sales.
🔹 Peak shopping hours were identified, optimizing ad timing.
🔹 Frequently bought-together products provided insights for bundle promotions.
🔹 The best-selling product was identified, helping businesses optimize stock and marketing.
🚀 Future Scope
📍 Extending the analysis with recent sales data (2021-2025)
